# MainreX's CS:GO Config

Put *autoexec.cfg* in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` or take what you want from it and add to your autoexec config! 

After the Wild West Simulator 2015 update, *video.txt* needs to be put in `...\Steam\userdata\<Steam3 ID>\730\local\cfg`
